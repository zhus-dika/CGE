# CGE

This repository contains a computational general equilibrium (CGE) model for policy analysis. The model based off of the simplest CGE model presented [Hosoe, Gawana, and Hashimoto (2010)](https://www.amazon.com/Textbook-Computable-General-Equilibrium-Modeling/dp/0230248144) and the source code is written in Python.

This work is very preliminary.  More details will be posted as development continues.

## Disclaimer

The model is currently under development. Please do not cite.

## Installing and Running CGE from this GitHub repository
